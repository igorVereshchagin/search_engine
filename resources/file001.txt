Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway  The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost  and they seemed to lean towards each other  black and ominous  in the fading light  A vast silence reigned over the land  The land itself was a desolation  lifeless  without movement  so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness  There was a hint in it of laughter  but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx  a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility  It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life  It was the Wild  the savage  frozen  hearted Northland Wild   But there WAS life  abroad in the land and defiant  Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs  Their bristly fur was rimed with frost  Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths  spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost  Leather harness was on the dogs  and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind  The sled was without runners  It was made of stout birch bark  and its full surface rested on the snow  The front end of the sled was turned up  like a scroll  in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it  On the sled  securely lashed  was a long and narrow oblong box  There were other things on the sled blankets  an axe  and a coffee pot and frying pan  but prominent  occupying most of the space  was the long and narrow oblong box   In advance of the dogs  on wide snowshoes  toiled a man  At the rear of the sled toiled a second man  On the sled  in the box  lay a third man whose toil was over  a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again  It is not the way of the Wild to like movement  Life is an offence to it  for life is movement  and the Wild aims always to destroy movement  It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea  it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts  and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man man who is the most restless of life  ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement   But at front and rear  unawed and indomitable  toiled the two men who were not yet dead  Their bodies were covered with fur and soft tanned leather  Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible  This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques  undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost  But under it all they were men  penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence  puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure  pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space   They travelled on without speech  saving their breath for the work of their bodies  On every side was the silence  pressing upon them with a tangible presence  It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver  It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree  It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds  pressing out of them  like juices from the grape  all the false ardours and exaltations and undue self values of the human soul  until they perceived themselves finite and small  specks and motes  moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and inter play of the great blind elements and forces   An hour went by  and a second hour  The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade  when a faint far cry arose on the still air  It soared upward with a swift rush  till it reached its topmost note  where it persisted  palpitant and tense  and then slowly died away  It might have been a lost soul wailing  had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness  The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind  And then  across the narrow oblong box  each nodded to the other   A second cry arose  piercing the silence with needle like shrillness  Both men located the sound  It was to the rear  somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed  A third and answering cry arose  also to the rear and to the left of the second cry    They re after us  Bill   said the man at the front   His voice sounded hoarse and unreal  and he had spoken with apparent effort    Meat is scarce   answered his comrade   I ain t seen a rabbit sign for days    Thereafter they spoke no more  though their ears were keen for the hunting cries that continued to rise behind them   At the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce trees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp  The coffin  at the side of the fire  served for seat and table  The wolf dogs  clustered on the far side of the fire  snarled and bickered among themselves  but evinced no inclination to stray off into the darkness    Seems to me  Henry  they re stayin  remarkable close to camp   Bill commented   Henry  squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a piece of ice  nodded  Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat    They know where their hides is safe   he said   They d sooner eat grub than be grub  They re pretty wise  them dogs    Bill shook his head   Oh  I don t know    His comrade looked at him curiously   First time I ever heard you say anything about their not bein  wise     Henry   said the other  munching with deliberation the beans he was eating   did you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when I was a feedin   em     They did cut up more n usual   Henry acknowledged    How many dogs ‘ve we got  Henry     Six     Well  Henry         Bill stopped for a moment  in order that his words might gain greater significance   As I was sayin   Henry  we ve got six dogs  I took six fish out of the bag  I gave one fish to each dog  an   Henry  I was one fish short     You counted wrong     We ve got six dogs   the other reiterated dispassionately   I took out six fish  One Ear didn t get no fish  I came back to the bag afterward an  got ‘m his fish       We ve only got six dogs   Henry said      Henry   Bill went on   I won t say they was all dogs  but there was seven of ‘m that got fish      Henry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs      There s only six now   he said      I saw the other one run off across the snow   Bill announced with cool positiveness   I saw seven      Henry looked at him commiseratingly  and said   I ll be almighty glad when this trip s over       What d ye mean by that   Bill demanded      I mean that this load of ourn is gettin  on your nerves  an  that you re beginnin  to see things       I thought of that   Bill answered gravely   An  so  when I saw it run off across the snow  I looked in the snow an  saw its tracks  Then I counted the dogs an  there was still six of  em  The tracks is there in the snow now  D ye want to look at  em  I ll show  em to you      Henry did not reply  but munched on in silence  until  the meal finished  he topped it with a final cup a of coffee  He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said      Then you re thinkin  as it was      A long wailing cry  fiercely sad  from somewhere in the darkness  had interrupted him  He stopped to listen to it  then he finished his sentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry    one of them      Bill nodded   I d a blame sight sooner think that than anything else  You noticed yourself the row the dogs made      Cry after cry  and answering cries  were turning the silence into a bedlam  From every side the cries arose  and the dogs betrayed their fear by huddling together and so close to the fire that their hair was scorched by the heat  Bill threw on more wood  before lighting his pipe      I m thinking you re down in the mouth some   Henry said      Henry         He sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before he went on   Henry  I was a thinkin  what a blame sight luckier he is than you an  me ll ever be      He indicated the third person by a downward thrust of the thumb to the box on which they sat      You an  me  Henry  when we die  we ll be lucky if we get enough stones over our carcases to keep the dogs off of us       But we ain t got people an  money an  all the rest  like him   Henry rejoined   Long distance funerals is somethin  you an  me can t exactly afford       What gets me  Henry  is what a chap like this  that s a lord or something in his own country  and that s never had to bother about grub nor blankets  why he comes a buttin  round the Godforsaken ends of the earth that s what I can t exactly see
